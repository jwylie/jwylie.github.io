A PhD student at Edinburgh Napier University funded by the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland.  The focus of this research is on the verification of federated unlearning.   My research interests include the privacy and security of machine learning as well as the use of machine learning for cybersecurity applications.  I have previously completed BEng (Hons) Cybersecurity and Forensics and MSc Advanced Security and Digital Forensics degrees at Edinburgh Napier University.  Both of my dissertations for these degrees focused on the application of machine learning for cybersecurity.  In additon, I have also worked on three research projects as a research assistant investigating the generation of metamorphic Android malware to improve detection systems.
